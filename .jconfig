# mode: 
# Set the default selection mode.  Valid choices are 'crop' or
# 'simple'.  Crop allows the user to create a bounding box with the mouse, 
# whereas simple only allows the user to select vertical boundaries by
# clicking with the mouse (orizontal boundaries are the image width
# boundaries)
#mode = simple
mode = crop

# window_size:
# Set the default size of the window containing the application.  Must be a 
# value of the form <width> <height> where each <width> and <height> are 
# replaced with positive numerical values specifying the number of pixels for 
# the width and height respectively.
window_size = 900 900

# window_pos:
# Set the default initial position (top left corner) of the window containing
# the application.  Must be a value of the form <left> <top> where
# each of the two arguments are numerical integers specifying the number of 
# pixels to move in from the left, top respectively edges before placing the 
# window on the screen
window_pos = 0 0

# canvas_size:
# Set the default size of the canvas upon which the image will be displayed.  
# Must be a value of the form <width> <height> where each <width> and <height> 
# are # replaced with positive numerical values specifying the number of pixels
# for the width and height respectively.  These values should be smaller than
# those specified in the window_size
canvas_size = 620 825

# bucket_size:
# Set the default size of each classification bucket displayed around the
# canvas.  These are initial guidelines only, and the application will
# automatically expand them to fit in the available space (if there is room
# for them).
bucket_size = 50 50

# snap_threshold:
# Sets the required percentage of non-background pixels that must be found
# when scanning a single line of a selection rectangle to prohibit it from
# being passed over when snapping it to text.  This value must lie in the
# range [0...100] and can take on fractions if neccessary
snap_threshold = 1

# classes:
# List of possible classification types based on the component of the journal
# that they represent.  Each item will contain a string specifying its name
# and a string giving its colour (symbolic equivalent of the 8-bit RGB
# values).  Each classifier will be separted by whitespace/newlines, and the 
# component name and colour can not contain any spaces.
