% mode: 
% Set the default selection mode.  Valid choices are 'crop' or
% 'simple'.  Crop allows the user to create a bounding box with the mouse, 
% whereas simple only allows the user to select vertical boundaries by
% clicking with the mouse (orizontal boundaries are the image width
% boundaries)
%mode = simple
mode = crop

% window_size:
% Set the default size of the window containing the application.  Must be a 
% value of the form <width> <height> where each <width> and <height> are 
% replaced with positive numerical values specifying the number of pixels for 
% the width and height respectively.
window_size = 900 900

% window_pos:
% Set the default initial position (top left corner) of the window containing
% the application.  Must be a value of the form <left> <top> where
% each of the two arguments are numerical integers specifying the number of 
% pixels to move in from the left, top respectively edges before placing the 
% window on the screen
window_pos = 0 0

% canvas_size:
% Set the default size of the canvas upon which the image will be displayed.  
% Must be a value of the form <width> <height> where each <width> and <height> 
% are replaced with positive numerical values specifying the number of pixels
% for the width and height respectively.  These values should be smaller than
% those specified in the window_size
canvas_size = 620 825

% bucket_size:
% Set the default size of each classification bucket displayed around the
% canvas.  These are initial guidelines only, and the application will
% automatically expand them to fit in the available space (if there is room
% for them).
bucket_size = 50 50

% snap_threshold:
% Sets the required percentage of non-background pixels that must be found
% when scanning a single line of a selection rectangle to prohibit it from
% being passed over when snapping it to text.  This value must lie in the
% range [0...100] and can take on fractions if neccessary
snap_threshold = 1

% classes:
% List of possible classification types based on the component of the journal
% that they represent.  Each item will contain a string specifying its name
% and a string giving its colour (symbolic equivalent of the 8-bit RGB
% values).  Each classifier will be separted by whitespace/newlines, and the 
% component name and colour can not contain any spaces.
