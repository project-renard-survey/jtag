1. Directory Contents
---------------------

This directory stores tarballs and source files for any of JTAG's dependant
applications.  These applications need to be compiled and installed (or
already exist on the user's system) before they will be able to use the JTAG
application.  The install_jtag.sh script in the scripts directory takes care
of the dependency checking and compilation / installation procedures 
automatically.


2. File Contents
----------------

README - this file
ActiveTcl8.4.4.0-linux-ix86.tar.gz - This tarball contains a complete Tcl/Tk
                                     distribution with lots of additional 
                                     libraries (like TkImg) thrown in and 
                                     precompiled for Linux machines.
BLT2.4z.tar.gz  - This tarball contains the source distribution of the BLT
                  Tcl/Tk libraries.  The JTAG application uses these libraries
                  to perform tasks such as drag & drop of selections.
blt2.4z-patch-2 - This is a patchfile for BLT source tarball above.  It
                  contains some bugfixes and updates.  Probably not a
                  necessity for the JTAG application, but its nice to be up to
                  date.


3. Installing the JTAG Application
----------------------------------

Since the JTAG application is written in Tcl/Tk (an interpreted language) no
compilation is necessary.

All you must do is ensure that you have the following available on your local 
machine:

  * Tcl/Tk 8.4 (tested with 8.4.3)
  * TkImg 1.3 (aka Img extensions)
  * BLT 2.4 (tested with 2.4z)
  * libtiff, libjpeg etc.  All these are included with TkImg
 
To automatically test for and install any missing dependencies from the list
above, simply issue:

  scripts/install_jtag.sh

from this directory, and follow the on screen directions given.  Note that
the only tested platform currently is Linux, but other *NIX platforms should
probably be little (no??) effort to port to.
