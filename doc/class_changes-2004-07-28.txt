Here are the (hopefully) final changes that I plan to make in the classes:

1. Add a "figure" class.
    1.1 Divide figures into "image" for actual images, "graph" for anything
        that is clearly a graph, and "figure" for all others.

2. Remove the "Inline Heading" class altogether.  By its definition, this 
   class requires weird segmentation to exist.

3. Remove the "Equation_Numbered" class altogether.  All instances of it have
   already been removed, so there is no point in keeping it around.

4. Remove the "end_notes" class altogether.  It has not been used.

5. Remove the "toc" class altogether.  It has not been used.
