Config File Reading
-------------------
 * Write File::parse method to read a config file, creating a list of its
   elements
 * Complete Config::read_config to locate the config file (curr dir or home)
 * Config::read_config must then set the values for the variables based on
   what was read

.jatg File Reading
------------------
 * When opening an image must look for and load <img_file>.jtag if it exists
 * Need to parse that file to display selections made
 * Must work to keep it correct during resize / scrolling

Menu Completion
---------------
 * Need to create buttons and commands in the file menu to open a file.
 * Need to create buttons and commands for the zoom menu (different presets)
 * Need the ability to flip between pages (if multi-page tiff for ex.)
 * Create a status bar giving info on # of pages, current page, selection mode

Multiple page files
-------------------
 * this may be handled externally (ex via tiffsplit), and we will only load
   multiple page files if they are named in a certain format (ex file1-1.tif, 
   file1-2.tif)

Selections
----------
 * Must implement dragging over a selection once complete to place it in a 
   bucket
 * Must keep a list of current selections, ability to modify arbitrary
   elements inside the list, and the ability to write the list to a file
   (.jtag) must be implemented.

Function Call Hardening
-----------------------
 * Each call should be enclosed in a catch (except for trivial things).  The
   receiver should display a debug message, and in the case of showstopping
   errors (not safe to continue), throw an error of its own.  This repeats
   all the way up the call chain until it is safe to stop, or the app
   terminates
 * same goes for library/internal calls.  Guard against unexpected errors with
   catches
