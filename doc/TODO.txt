.jlog File Reading
------------------
 * Should do at the same time as jtag file reading and follow a format similar
   to ::Jtag::Config::read_data

.jlog File Writing
------------------
 * Must first implement proper auxilliary data handling (selection and
   classification times need updating to be handled properly)
 * Will need to write ::Jtag::Config::write_jlog method similar to write_data

Menu Completion
---------------
 * Need to create buttons and commands for the zoom menu (different presets)
 * Need the ability to flip between pages (if multi-page tiff for ex.)
 * Create a status bar giving info on # of pages, current page, selection mode
 *? Ability to undo selctions
 * create 'auto_classify' button that ties into training data and classifier
   app.

Multiple page files
-------------------
 * this will be handled externally (via tiffsplit), and we will only load
   multiple page files if they are named in the format that results from
   tiffsplit (i.e. img1aa.tif img1ab.tif ... img1zz.tif)

Image Related
-------------
 * Update selection so that when creating rectangle and moving outside of
   display window, we automatically scroll in the proper direction
 * Shrink window to the size of the image (should never see blank canvas)

Function Call Hardening
-----------------------
 * Each call should be enclosed in a catch (except for trivial things).  The
   receiver should display a debug message, and in the case of showstopping
   errors (not safe to continue), throw an error of its own.  This repeats
   all the way up the call chain until it is safe to stop, or the app
   terminates
 * same goes for library/internal calls.  Guard against unexpected errors with
   catches
