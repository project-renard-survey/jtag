Menu Completion
---------------
 * Need to create buttons and commands for the zoom menu (different presets)
 * Create a status bar giving info on # of pages, current page, selection mode
 *? Ability to undo selctions
 * create 'auto_classify' button that ties into training data and classifier
   app.

Image Related
-------------
 * Update selection so that when creating rectangle and moving outside of
   display window, we automatically scroll in the proper direction
 * Shrink window to the size of the image (should never see blank canvas)

Classification Related
----------------------
 * Create command/ability to split a box into 2 (user could then
   resize/reclassify it as necc)
 * Create/record ability for user to group selections together.  Write info to
   jtag file (i.e. box 1 group with box 3 and 4)


Function Call Hardening
-----------------------
 * Each call should be enclosed in a catch (except for trivial things).  The
   receiver should display a debug message, and in the case of showstopping
   errors (not safe to continue), throw an error of its own.  This repeats
   all the way up the call chain until it is safe to stop, or the app
   terminates
 * same goes for library/internal calls.  Guard against unexpected errors with
   catches

Application Design
------------------
 * Audit all code, and potentially redesign/re-engineer where needed (ex. poss. 
   separate file to deal with all things related to a single selection, move 
   code around etc.)
