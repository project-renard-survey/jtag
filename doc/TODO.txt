Menu Completion
---------------
 * Need to create buttons and commands for the zoom menu (different presets)

Image Related
-------------
 * Update selection so that when creating rectangle and moving outside of
   display window, we automatically scroll in the proper direction
 * Shrink window to the size of the image (should never see blank canvas) or
   at least prevent selections from extending beyond edge of image.
 * Make regions automatically SNAP after being split.
 * Make SNAP incremental (horiz, vert, h, v, etc.), rather than all at once.
 * Remove image magick dependency for determining file type (make own
   built-in)
 * fix snap bug that occurs after manually resizing another selection

Function Call Hardening
-----------------------
 * Each call should be enclosed in a catch (except for trivial things).  The
   receiver should display a debug message, and in the case of showstopping
   errors (not safe to continue), throw an error of its own.  This repeats
   all the way up the call chain until it is safe to stop, or the app
   terminates
 * same goes for library/internal calls.  Guard against unexpected errors with
   catches

Application Design
------------------
 * Audit all code, and potentially redesign/re-engineer where needed (ex. poss. 
   separate file to deal with all things related to a single selection, move 
   code around etc.)

 * Port to Mac, update matlab scripts to be octave compatible

 Documentation
 -------------
  * generate a useage.txt end user guide and roll it into the application when
    they press the 'help' button
