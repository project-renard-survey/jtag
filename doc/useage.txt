1. Starting Up
--------------

First ensure that you have installed the JTAG application and its dependent
software locally on your machine (see the top-level README file for
instructions on how to do this).

Once installed, you can start the JTAG application by entering the top-level
directory and issuing:

    ./main.tcl

from the command line.  This will start up and display the GUI, and from there
you can begin loading journal images for tagging.

Alternately, you can specify a journal image to load upon startup by passing
its path and name as a parameter.  If I had a file in my home directory called
img1.tiff I would load it on startup as follows (after cd'ing to the top-level
JTAG directory):

    ./main.tcl ~/img1.tiff

1.1 Supported Image Formats
---------------------------

One of the main purposes of the JTAG application is to render and display
raster image representations of journal articles.  All of this image rendering
and manipulation is carried out by an external Tcl/Tk library called TkImg.
It transparently supports all of the following formats (although only TIFF,
and JPG have been tested thus far):

  - tiff
  - jpeg
  - gif
  - png
  - bmp
  - xbm
  - xpm
  - partial postscript support (flakey and possibly broken)

Since most journal articles will come in multiple-page postscript or Adobe pdf
format, I have written a script to automatically convert such files, into
individual tiff files (1 page per file) for input into the JTAG application.
See the README file in the scripts directory as well as the file
scripts/pdf_to_tiff.pl for more information on converting to an appropriate
image format.

1.2 Configuration and Customization
-----------------------------------

A large portion of the default behaviour of the JTAG application can be
customized by the user before startup.  This is accomplished through the use
of a config file called .jconfig.  The application searches for this file upon
initial startup, first in the current directory, then secondly in the current
users home directory.  It then proceeds to read and load the config variable
values from the first .jconfig file it finds.  If a valid .jconfig file can
not be found, it loads a series of default values.  To see what these values
are you can have a look at the beginning of the config.tcl file.  For further
information on each config variable see the sample .jconfig file in the
top-level directory, as well as section 3. below.


2. Basic Controls and Actions
-----------------------------

Upon first loading the JTAG application you will see a menu and various
buttons along the top, 2 vertical columns of buckets containing various class
names & colours, and the main image viewing window.  Interaction with the
application is accomplished through mouse movements, mouse button presses, and
various keyboard combinations.

2.1 Image Display
-----------------

A journal image file can be opened for display by either selecting "Open" from
the File menu using the mouse, or with the keyboard shortcut <Ctrl><o> (i.e.
pressing the Ctrl key while also pressing the o key).  If an image is already
being displayed when a new image is opened, the previous image's selections
(if any) are saved to disk first before the new image is opened.

In order to get a better view of the image one can zoom in and out to magnify
and shrink what is shown.  Zooming in increases the magnification (allowing
one to focus on a portion of the document in detail) and zooming out does the
opposite.  This can be accomplished with the mouse by pressing the "Zoom In"
or "Zoom out" button, or by clicking on the desired zoom magnification from
the Zoom menu.  Alternately, one can incrementally zoom in (out) by pressing
the <+> key (<-> key).

If the image is magnified such that it doesn't entirely fit in the display
window a vertical and/or horizontal scrollbar will appear around the
right/bottom edge of the image window.  Using the mouse, one can slide the
scrollbar to view other regions of the document.

2.2 Creating Selections
-----------------------

A selection is a rectangular region of ink that belongs to a single class
(Ex. the ink making up an article title, or equation, or page number etc.)
The main purpose of the JTAG application is to allow one to hand create such
selections and view them on screen.

With an image displayed on screen, a selection can be created by hand using
the mouse.  Simply move the mouse over where you want the selection to begin
(one corner of the region), then press and hold down the left mouse button.
With the left mouse button held, begin to drag the mouse towards the opposite
corner, as you do so you will see a rectangular box being drawn.  Once the
rectangular box encloses your region, let go of the left mouse button (the
black rectangular box should remain).  Note that this box is not yet
classified (see section 2.6 on how to associate it with a class).

By default the selection you draw out is "snapped" inward on each side until
it touches a significant portion of ink (this ensures accurate results when
creating training data etc.).  Sometimes however, snapping the selection chops 
off too much, or you would like to manually set the size of the box.  To
resize a selection once it has initially been drawn out can be accomplished by
moving the mouse into the selection, then towards the edge you wish to resize.
At that point you will see the mouse cursor change and left clicking and
holding you can now move the mouse and that edge will move too.  When you are
happy with the resize, let go of the left mouse button to finish the change.
You can also shrink 2 adjacent edges at the same time by moving the mouse to the
corner (where the edges meet) and repeating the procedure outlined above.

If you have resized a selection manually and would like to snap it to ink,
this can be accomplished by selecting "Snap Selection" from the Edit menu,
then left clicking inside the selection you wish to snap (left-click outside
of all selections to cancel this).  Alternately, you can place the mouse
inside the selection you wish to snap, press <Ctrl><n> on the keyboard, and
left click inside of it once the cursor icon changes to a crosshair.

Selections can also be created automatically (if MATLAB is installed, and you
have set configuration settings to include training data -- see section 1.2).
If there are no selections currently on the page displayed, and you click the
"Auto Predict Selections" button with the mouse, the application will attempt
to segment the document into regions and classify them using the learner you
specify.

2.3 Deleting Selections
-----------------------

If you wish to delete a selection, you can either select "Delete Selection"
from the Edit menu, then left-click inside the selection you wish to delete
(left-click outside of all selections to cancel this).  Alternately, you can
press <Ctrl><x> on the keyboard then left-click inside of the selection you
want to delete.

2.4 Splitting Selections
------------------------

If you wish to split a region into two regions (for instance if you let the
application detect regions and it incorrectly grouped multiple ones under a
single region), you can do so by selecting "Split Selection" from the Edit
menu.  Then move the mouse inside the selection you wish to split.  You will
see a vertical (or horizontal) line stretching from edge to edge of the
selection.  Move the line where you would like the split to occur, then
left-click to carry out the split.  If you would like to change the line from
vertical to horizontal (or vice versa), simply right-click with the mouse
before you finish creating the split (i.e. before you left-click).
Alternately you can start the split process by pressing <Ctrl><p> from the
keyboard, then following the procedure above.  To cancel the split, simply
left-click outside of all selections.

2.5 Merging Selections
----------------------

If you have two or more adjacent selections that should be grouped as one
single selection, simply select "Merge Selections" from the Edit menu.  Then
using the mouse, move it inside each of the selections you wish to include in
the merge and left-click inside of it (when you move outside that selection it
should remain highlighted).  Once you have highlighted all the selections you
wish to include in the merge, simply right-click and a new single rectangle
will be created using the outermost co-ordinates of each of the selected
rectangles.  If you have highlighted a selection for inclusion in the merge
and you wish to change that, you can do so by left-clicking inside of it a
second time (now when you move outside of it, it should not remain
highlighted).  To cancel the merge, simply un-highlight each selection and
right-click the mouse.  You can also being the merging process by pressing
<Ctrl><m> with the keyboard, then proceed as explained above.

2.6 Classifying Selections
--------------------------

Once a selection has been created, it should be classified (as text, or a page
number etc.).  To accomplish this simply move the mouse inside the selection
you wish to classify, then click and hold the left mouse button.  Then with
the left-button held down, simply drag the mouse over the bucket you wish to
classify the selection as.  You will see that a floating button is created
called "selection" while you drag the mouse.  You can let go of the left-mouse
button once the bucket you wish to classify the selection is highlighted.
Once a selection is classified it is diplayed in the same colour as its
bucket.

To change the classification of a selection, simply drag it to the new bucket
following the procedure above.

You can also let the application guess at the classification for all
selections currently on the page by pressing the "Auto Predict Selections"
button (this button is displayed if you have MATLAB installed and you have set
the .jconfig file appropriately).

2.7 Saving Results
------------------

You can save the selections created out to disk at any time either by
selecting "Save" from the File menu, or by pressing <Ctrl><s> from the
keyboard.  This will result in files in the same directory as the image file
created, one with a .jtag extension, and one with a .jlog extension.  The jtag
file is in ASCII format, and stores selection information (co-ordinates,
class, etc.), configuration information, and image information.  The jlog file
is also in ASCII format, but it stores auxiliary data like the time taken to
create a selection, or classify it etc.

2.8 Switching Pages
-------------------

If image files happen to be multiple pages from the same journal, they can
easily be recognized as such and switch between while the application is
running.  Consecutive images from the same journal should have the same base
filename followed by .aa for the first page, .ab for the second and so on (up
to .zz).  Following the page should be the image format .tif or .jpg for
example.  So a valid page 3 of an image named foo.tif would be foo.ac.tif for
example.

If a file is recognized as being multiple pages, you can switch to the
previous or next page simply be clicking on the "Prev Page" button or "Next
Page" button with the mouse.  Alternately, you can do the same with the
keyboard by pressing the <Page Up> or <Page Down> keys.

When you switch pages, the contents of the first page are saved to disk before
the next page is loaded.


3. Configuration & Customization
--------------------------------

As discussed in section 1.2 above, the JTAG application makes extensive use of
the .jconfig file to set most configurable aspects.  For a discussion of what
each config item does, and how to set its value, see the sample .jconfig file
kept in the top-level directory.

Customization can also be made to the scripts in the matlab directory (for
things like segmentation thresholds etc.), since these are used with the auto-
predict feature to come up with selections and predict classifications.  For
more information on how to setup these variables, see the README file in the
matlab directory.


4. Limitations & Misc. Issues
-----------------------------

Tcl/Tk and the TkImg toolkit use a rather crude representation for images (at
least tiff files) whereby they use 32 bits per pixel and render the *entire*
image at any given time.  As a result, any large (in terms of number of
pixels) image will take up a large amount of memory while the application is
running.  Further compounding the problem occurs whenever you zoom in on the
page repeatedly.  Increasing the magnification simply doubles etc. the number 
of pixels that have to be rendered.  At extremely high magnifications this
takes a large amount of cpu-time and largely increases the memory footprint of
the application.  It is best not to zoom in too much!

When creating selections, you should classify them as soon as you finish
creating one (as opposed to creating multiple selections then classifying
each).  The way the application was designed, it only stores auxiliary
information for the most recently created selection.  This information is only
save internally, after it has been classified.  As a result if a new selection
is created before classification, the originals auxiliary data may be lost or
become garbage.

If a selection is really narrow (in the vertical or horizontal sense) it may
be automatically deleted.  This feature was put in place to ensure that each
rectangle created is larger than a minimum size (so random noise and "dirt"
are not created as selections.  A trick to creating "thin" selections that
should stay as selections involves making them to large to begin with (by
including another region), then classify it, then resize it manually so you
are only left with the thin piece of ink and whitespace, then snap it to a
region.
