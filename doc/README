1. Directory Contents
---------------------

This directory contains all the collected documentation on the JTAG
application, and should be the main source for information (other than the
README files in each directory).  Ideally, as the application and its helper
components continue to evolve, this documentation will continue to evolve
along with it.


2. File Contents
----------------

README - this file
TODO.txt - An irregularly updated text file containing a list of things that
           still must be completed for the JTAG application or any of its 
           helper scripts and components.
building_a_data_set.txt - Gives an overview of scripts available to train and
                         run classification algorithms on tagged page images.
classlist.txt - This gives a definition of what each class in the program
                entails.  Useful when deciding how to tag new pages.
segmentation_alg_survey.ps - This postscript file contains a survey of several
                             bottom-up and top-down page segmentation 
                             algorithms, and was used as the basis for the 
                             matlab/xycut.m file (currently used to segment 
                             pages by the JTAG MATLAB helper scripts).
specification.txt - This text file outlines the original specification of the
                    JTAG application.  It was this file that was used to
                    discern necessary functionality and drive the design and
                    implementation of the JTAG application.  It is a good
                    place to start reading if you want to get into (and
                    further develop) the internals of the JTAG application.
useage.txt - This text file contains end-user instruction and details how one 
             actually uses the JTAG application.
