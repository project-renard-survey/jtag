Added files describing desired improvements to jtag, as well as a first draft of the rules for manual tagging.



Manual Tagging Rules
--------------------
There are many situations in tagging where a judgement call is required.  This
document is intended to help clarify these situations, and thus make things more
consistent.

Note that this document is expected to evolve, but hopefully not too much.



Definitions
-----------

'header'
-A header at the top of a page.  If the header is composed of more than one part 
(eg part of it is left-aligned, part is right-aligned), these should be separate 
regions.


'code_block'
-A block of code, or code-like text.  The code should be broken into several 
regions if there are full blank lines between lines of code.


'section_heading'
-A top-level heading, such as "1. Introduction".


'subsection_heading'
-A second, third, fourth, etc. level heading, such as "1.2 Motivation for 
Research" or "1.2.1.4 Why They Did it That Way".


'inline_heading'
-A heading which shares a line with the text, such as
"2.3 Workload: The algorithm divides the workload among all available"
"processors in a provable optimal manner..."
The regions should look like:
 ___________________________
|____IH____|_____Text_______|
|                           |
|________Text_______________|


'decoration'
-Bits of ink detached from other regions, used to decorate or divide the space.  
Common decorations include horizontal lines above footnotes, and squares used to 
denote QED at the end of proofs.  If the sqaure at the end of a proof is very 
close to a line of an equation, it should be grouped in with that equation.


'figure_label'
-The label assigned to a figure, such as "Figure 3".


'figure_caption'
-The caption assigned to a figure, usually paired with a figure_label element:
"Figure 3: Distribution of nose-hair lengths among penguin population."


'references'
-References, usually found at the end of a paper.
-Each reference should be its own region.


'abstract'
-The abstract, usually found at the beginning of the paper.  The word "Abstract" 
which generally appears at the top should be part of this region.


'text'
-Any block of text.  If paragraphs have a line of whitespace between them, they 
should be separated into different regions.  Otherwise, they should be grouped 
together.


'bullet_item'
-A single item in a bulleted or numbered list.
-Even if there is no line of whitespace between lines, multiple bullet items
should each be given a separate region.


'equation_numbered'
-This is a depricated tag, and should not be used.  It should be replaced with 
an "equation" / "eq_number" pair.


'pg_number'
-The page number.  Usually found at the bottom of the page.


'table'
-A table.  Cells can be separated by lines, or by whitespace.


'main_title'
-The main title of the paper.


'footer'
-A footer is a small bit of repeating text found at the bottom of each page.  
This is NOT the same as a footnote, which explains some detail about the 
contents of the paper.


'toc'
-Table of Contents.  So far as I am aware, this is not used.


'table_label'
-The label assigned to a table, such as "Table 3".


'table_caption'
-The description assigned to a table, usually paired with a table_label element:
"Table 3: Joint probability distribution for both populations."


'end_notes'
-So far s I know, these are not used.


'equation'
-An equation.  The "no_number" indicates that the equation number (if provided) 
should be given its own region.


'eq_number'
-The number (or letter) assigned to a particular equation.  Always paired with
an "equation" region.


'authour_list'
-Information about the authors of the paper.  Usually comes at the beginning of 
the paper.  If some information is left-aligned, and some is right-aligned, and 
there is a significant space between them, the left and right aligned sections 
should each get their own region.


'footnote'
-A footnote explains some detail about the contents of the paper.  This is NOT 
the same as a footer, whihc is a small bit of repeating text found at the bottom 
of each page.


'image'
-A picture (photograph, handdrawn, etc.) in the paper.


'graph'
-A graph or chart of any sort.


'editor_list'
-List of editors for a paper.

The general strategy is to
