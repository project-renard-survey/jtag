Instructions for building a data set

Building a data set
--------------------------

The file build_all_td.m will prepare a full training and test set.  It will
be much easier to just change a copy of this file if you want to do it
slightly differently than to start from scratch.

The easiest way to use this file is to create a directory for each part of
the data set you want to create, copy the jtag and tif files to that
directory, and then and change the first half-dozen lines of
build_all_td.m to match this.

Whenever you build training data, a global variable called "use" must be
declared, with the following boolean fields:
use.dist   %Whether to use the distance-based features
use.snap   %Whether to use the snapped-rectangle based features
use.dens   %Whether to use the pixel-density based features
use.mark   %Whether to use the marks-based features
use.ocr    %Whether to use the ocr-based features
use.pnum   %Whether to use the page-number based features

See the file startup.m for the current default values.

The file build_all_td.m requires you to provide a "batch name".  This is the 
file path, plus a name, for the data set you are creating.  The following
naming convention will be followed by build_all_td.m:
<batchname>-<journal>-<test/train>.<method>.mat

<batchname> is the file path, plus a name.
<journal> is the journal being used, such as nips
<test/train> is either "train" (for the training data) or "test" (for the
             test data
<method> is the labelling method that this data is intended to be used with,
         such as lr for Logistic Regression, or knn for K Nearest Neighbours.
         Note that the training data for KNN is actually the raw data itself,
         so if you are looking for the raw feature data, you should use the
         xxxxxxx-knn.mat files.
         
For example, './results/2004-10-04-nips-test-knn.mat' would be from the
batch named "./results/2004-10-04', for the journal NIPS, the test data
for K Nearest Neighbours (which is the raw feature data), and
'./results/2004-10-04-nips-train.lr.mat' is the Logistic Regression weights
for the training data in the same batch.



Testing the data set
------------------------

The file test_all_data.m is a script for testing a given batch under all of
the classification methods that have been coded so far.  You can examine
this file for how to go about doing this.  If the training data you built
stuck to the naming conventions used in build_all_td.m, then you need only
call "test_all_data(batchname)", and all of the testing will be run
automatically.
