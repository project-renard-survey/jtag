To Do
------

Normalize the features in each data set before saving (do some research to make sure this is done right).

Analyze which distance features are useful (how do I do this?  FA?  PCA?  Look this up).

Remove the non-useful distance features.

Add some new distance features:
  -Height
  -Width
  -Aspect Ratio (what's the best way to do this?)
  -More/other???


  
  
  
Add some "marks" features:
  -Number of marks
  -Ratio of # of marks to area
  -Width of widest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Height of tallest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Area of largest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Pixels in largest mark

Create a single train/test script

Re-train and re-test with new features
