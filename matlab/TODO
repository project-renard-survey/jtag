----------------------------------------------------
Thesis TOC Gaps:
----------------
3. Applications
    3.1 OCR Pre-Processing for searchable image-documents
    3.2 OCR Pre-Processing for compression and storage
    3.3 OCR Pre-Processing for HTML
    
----------------------------------------------------

<DONE>Re-test lr, knn, memm on new data.
<DONE>Fix up problems with LTC3, test 2 (rebuild lr weights)
<RUNNING>Test LTC3, test2
<RUNNING>Run TD extraction with Khash's new algorithms.
Fix up problems with LTC2, test 1
Code "Recursive Generative Segmentation"







<DONE>Fix bottom-of-page bug and re-run 2-col reflow examples

Read Yann Lecunn papers

Change LTC2 so that each sample doesn't include the feature names.

Implement the best-merge algorithm

Implement Voronoi Diagrams for best-merge

Test Voronoi Diagrams for best-merge

<DONE>Improve the document re-flowing

<DONE>Add extra feature for original Learn-To-Cut

<DONE>Implement "optimizing" Learn-To-Cut data collection

Train "optimizing" Learn-To-Cut

<DONE>Code "optimizing" Learn-To-Cut cutting algorithm

Test "optimizing" Learn-To-Cut cutting algorithm

Add classification features:
    Does it have both vertical AND horizontal lines?
    Some measure of font size.
    
Consider second reader for thesis:
    -Rich Zemel
    -Brendon Frye
    -Aron Hertsmen
    -<Ron Becker>

Find error bars by randomly picking training and test cases for:
    Random articles:
        KNN
        LR
        MEMM
    Random pages:
        KNN
        LR
        MEMM

Implement MEMM
    <DONE>1. By adding booleans for previous class.
             <DONE>NOTE: Include a trailing "end-of-page" tag.
    2. By training a separate classifier for each previous class.

Check for sources of over-fitting: distrubute each paper between the
test and training data sets
