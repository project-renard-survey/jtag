To Do
------

Normalize the features in each data set before saving (do some research to make sure this is done right).

<DONE> Change the way the feature extraction functions work so that they accept all the rectanges at once, rather than one at a time.

Make sure the above changes work.

Add some new distance features:
  -Height
  -Width
  -Area
  -Aspect Ratio (what's the best way to do this?)
  -distance to neighbouring regions
  -% overlap of projection on nieghbouring features
  -Boolean "is centered"
  -Boolean "on (left/right/top/botton) edge"





Add some "marks" features:
  -Number of marks
  -Ratio of # of marks to area
  -Width of widest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Height of tallest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Area of largest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Pixels in largest mark

Create a single train/test script

Re-train and re-test with new features
