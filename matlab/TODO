To Do
------

Normalize the features in each data set before saving (do some research to make sure this is done right).

<DONE> Change the way the feature extraction functions work so that they accept all the rectangles at once, rather than one at a time.

<DONE> Make sure the above changes work.

Add some new distance features:
  <DONE>-Height
  <DONE>-Width
  <DONE>-Area
  <DONE>-Aspect Ratio (what's the best way to do this?)
  <DONE>-distance to neighbouring regions
  <DONE>-% overlap of projection on nieghbouring features
  <DONE>-Boolean "is centered"
  <DONE>-Boolean "on (left/right/top/botton) edge"

<DONE> Debug the new features
  -Getting negative values, when we shouldn't

<DONE> Normalize the new features


Add some "marks" features:
  -Number of marks
  -Ratio of # of marks to area
  -Width of widest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Height of tallest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Area of largest mark (as fraction of total?)
  -Pixels in largest mark

<DONE> Create a single train/test script

<DONE> Re-train and re-test with new features

Implement HMM

Get ready to send stuff to Microsoft

Decide on consistent style for Inline Heading, Author List, and 
References.

Go over test data and training data, to make above items consistent.
