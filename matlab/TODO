To Do
------

Normalize the features in each data set before saving (do some research to make sure this is done right).

<DONE> Change the way the feature extraction functions work so that they accept all the rectangles at once, rather than one at a time.

<DONE> Make sure the above changes work.

<DONE> Add some new distance features:
  <DONE>-Height
  <DONE>-Width
  <DONE>-Area
  <DONE>-Aspect Ratio (what's the best way to do this?)
  <DONE>-distance to neighbouring regions
  <DONE>-% overlap of projection on nieghbouring features
  <DONE>-Boolean "is centered"
  <DONE>-Boolean "on (left/right/top/botton) edge"

<DONE> Debug the new features
  -Getting negative values, when we shouldn't

<DONE> Normalize the new features


<DONE> Add some "marks" features:
  <DONE>-Number of marks
  <DONE>-Ratio of # of marks to area
  <DONE>-Width of widest mark (as fraction of total?)
  <DONE>-Height of tallest mark (as fraction of total?)
  <DONE>-Area of largest mark (as fraction of total?)
  <DONE>-Pixels in largest mark

<DONE> Make the marks features reasonably quick to compute.

<DONE> Create a single train/test script

<DONE> Re-train and re-test with new features

Figure out why the marks features are decreasing performance.

<DONE>Clean up test data
    Bach02
    Cannon02
    Chickering02a
    Collobert01a
    Crammer03b

<DONE>Clean up training data
    Allwein00a
    Antos02a
    Callif03a
    Cancedda03a
    Caruana03a
    Chan02a
    Chickering02b
    Christensen03a
    Crammer01a
    Crammer03a

<DONE>Fix up "snapping" errors in test and training data

<CANCELLED>Check out OCR from http://rcat.utoronto.ca/

<CANCELLED>Check out "NCA" for KNN (talk to Jacob)



<DONE>Read about MEMM's
Implement MEMM
    <DONE>1. By adding booleans for previous class.
             <DONE>NOTE: Include a trailing "end-of-page" tag.
    2. By training a separate classifier for each previous class.







<DONE>Read about CRF's (Conditional Random Fields)
Implement CRF's

<DONE>Make changes requested by Sam for MS package

<DONE> Get ready to send stuff to Microsoft

<DONE> Decide on consistent style for Inline Heading, Author List, and 
References.

<DONE>Go over test data and training data, to make above items consistent.

Think about inferring font size before doing segmentation, and using this.
